# Brain Tumor Detection App

This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect brain tumors in medical images, offering potential applications in healthcare for aiding diagnosis. The solution involves building a machine learning model to classify brain tumor images accurately and implementing a mobile application for real-time detection.

• Deep Learning Classification: A model trained to detect brain tumors using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

• Mobile Application: Developed using Android Studio with TensorFlow Lite integration for real-time tumor detection from images.

• Real-time Inference: The mobile app processes images and runs inference directly on the device, making the solution portable and efficient.

The brain tumor image dataset was obtained from Kaggle and used for training and validating the model.
